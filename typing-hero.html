            <p>                
                <i>Typing Hero</i> is a <b>rogue-like</b> game made in Unity that teaches its players 
                how to type faster and more accurate. This is helped by the fact that every action in 
                this game, even moving, is done by typing it.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                As the main project of my Bachelor's Thesis in Computer Engineering, I wanted to try something a bit
                different from all of the projects suggested by the university. Then I decided to develop
                 a game on my own, but I had to make it educational in some way. <i>"How can I make an 
                    interesting, eductational yet entertaining game related to Computer Engineering?"</i> - I asked myself. 
                That's how I came up with the idea of making a fun typing practice tool with rogue-like components.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                I did all the code, the design, the planning and some of the art!

                <br/>
                <br/>

                <b><u>Disclaimer:</u> Since <i>Typing Hero</i> was a Bachelor's Thesis in the "Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid" in Spain, 
                    the game had to be in Spanish. That's why everything needs to be typed in this language and it's balanced around it.
                </b>

                            <p>
                                In this game, every action you want to perform is done by typing it. Players will have a <b>dictionary</b> 
                                with all posible <b>words</b> in that moment, such as movement abilities or a grand variety of attacks. You will find in the 
                                UI a box that represents the text you are typing, as well as a <b>words per minute counter</b>.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                These words are the key to defeating the increasingly number of enemies and obstacles coming your way. 
                                To get more words, you will have to open <b>chests</b> unlocking each of its locks (typing it, of course).

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                Inside these chests you will find powerful attacks, like the word <i>cannon</i> that launches a powerful piercing 
                                ray forward; or utility skills like <i>healing</i>, <i>shields</i> and much more!

                                There are many threats out there in space. You will have to dodge lots of asteroids coming to you, as well as facing 
                                numerous types of enemies. 
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                There are some enemies that will try to destroy your ship shooting at you or sending 
                                a homing mine, others will make you change your strategy by protecting some other enemies. In addition, there are others 
                                that will throw a hook towards you that, if you don't dodge it, you will be forced to type a certain random word to break free of its claws.
                            
                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                Make sure to grab every word you can, because these enemies will come in higher frequencies and higher numbers depending on the time you have been playing!
                            </p>

                                To face these dangers, words are not enough. Players will also need <b>items</b> that serve as incredibly powerful passive stats.
                                Some of these items are simply <i>damage up</i>, <i>cooldown reduction</i> or <i>speed up</i>, but there are others that change entirely
                                the way you play the game. These can be <i>auto-aim</i>, <i>triple shot</i> or <i>electric shock</i>, for example. All of these items affect 
                                every attack word you use.
                            
                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                To get these powerful items, you will need to take down all the enimies you can, as there is a random chance of them dropping a random item. 
                                Be sure to type swiftly as well, since the items will be falling out of the screen if you are not fast enough!
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                                The leaders of the KSR are formidable foes, players will have to be careful with their ingenious gimmicks.
                                The boss fights in <i>Typing Hero</i> are meant to be a kind of <b>typing test</b> to check the skills of the player. 
                                
                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                Some test your <b>typing speed</b>, like <i>The Void</i> who sends a black hole that pulls you towards its center and, if you touch this center, it's game over.
                                To avoid this, players will have to type a random text that will pop up on the screen. Every accurately typed character will pull you backwards, 
                                so make sure to type fast enough to avoid gravity's gasp.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                Others may also test your <b>typing accuracy</b>, like <i>The Hand</i>, who challenges the player to a "cowboy typing duel". This means that the player
                                will have to press a certain key or type a certain word that pops up on the screen before his opponent does. The contender that types it correctly first will "shoot" 
                                their opponent, damaging them.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            <p>
                                It was mentioned in several occasions some random words or texts may pop up as part of an attack of some enemies/bosses. These are selected from a 
                                huge embedded database with many words/texts that are categorized depending on their "difficulty". These words and texts have been provided by the official Spanish Language Organization 
                                called <b><a href="https://cervantes.org">Instituto Cervantes</a></b>.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                <i>Typing Hero</i> features 3 different difficulties, each one of them meant for people with different typing abilities. Maybe you are just trying to learn how to type, 
                                so the game becomes an easier experience with way less enemies, asteroids (and a less steep difficulty curve along the game) and random words/texts with shorter lengths.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bullet-point">
                            <p>
                                And much more! Like 7 different ships to play, with unique passive abilities, stats and a distinctive ultimate ability. 
                                This ability needs to be charged by defeating enemies or its passive charge gain and, when ready, the user needs to type <b>ultimate ability</b> (which is something risky due to the length of both words) 
                                to unleash the full power of the ship.
                                
                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                Some ships have powerful ultimate abilities such as a railgun, slow time or no cooldowns during some time. Others may even posses enemy ships, gaining their unique abilities. 
                                <br/>
                                Passive abilities are also quite important. For example, <i>Shorty</i> is a ship for the most skilled typers out there. Its passive changes the damage output of its next attack depending on the typing speed of the user.
                                If you are typing fast enough (accordingly to the length of the word), you will do extra damage! But if you are a bit slow, you may notice a substantial downgrade in your damage.

                        <u style="text-decoration-thickness: 2.5px;">Disclaimer:</u> Since <i>Typing Hero</i> was a Bachelor's Thesis in the "Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid" in Spain, 
                        the game had to be in Spanish. That's why everything needs to be typed in this language and it's balanced around it.

                        <br/>
                        
                        The game is not fully finished either, players may experience certain lesser bugs that should not affect gameplay drastically. Especially with the ship <i>Ghost</i>, which is not polished yet.
