            <h1 class="game-section-title">DESCRIPTION</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Pathogenesis</b> is a <b>puzzle platformer</b> game with pixel-art style made in Unity. Players will embark on an adventure 
                surviving in an alive world where there is a threat in every organism they face there.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                These organisms are the core mechanic of the game. Our protagonist, a <i>virus</i> born from an amalgamation 
                of the remians of other organisms, is not capable of going through the gloomy and fleshy dangers of this world on 
                its own. That is why it needs to <b>take advantage of the abilities of its enemies</b>, using them to overcome many puzzles and obstacles.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                In Pathogenesis, we aim for a new type of environment that we call <i>gruesome ASMR</i>. Players will find a relaxing game 
                but with gore elements. Our plans for the future with this game is to expand the world so the players can get the full experience 
                of this unique combination of feelings, exploring a world engulfed in flesh, bones and blood and discovering ingenious puzzles.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                
                I had the chance to work not only as a game programmer (implementing AI, interactable features, game systems and SFX), but also as 
                the <b>main producer</b> of the team. I organized the team, the meetings, all the tasks to do (using <i>HacknPlan</i>), 
                contacted some outsourcing and onboarded them, as well as created some trackers.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Have a look at the game with this <b>teaser</b>:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="game-trailer">
            <iframe 
                class="trailer"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/znT-RjZKzms">
            </iframe>
        </div>
        <div class="game-features">
            <h1 class="game-section-title">FEATURES</h1>
            <p>
                The world of <i>Pathogenesis</i> is full of dangers. To overcome these obstacles, the <i>virus</i> has a precise movement and jump 
                that allows it to get past most platforms. On top of that, thanks to its sliminess and viscosity, the <i>virus</i> can also go through 
                a certain type of terrain filled with moving tentacles that will grab onto it, allowing for some incredible vertical movement defying gravity.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                As mentioned previously above, the rest of the organisms are some of the core mechanics. Each one of them has a special movement passive and 
                active ability. If the protagonist can get close enough to get into contact with these organisms, it will possess them, gaining both of their abilities.                
                This is crucial for solving puzzles and getting though certain terrain obstacles.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                The most interesting thing about these organisms is the dynamic they create between them:
                
                <br/>

                They serve as a <b>rock/paper/scissors</b> system, due to the fact that each one of them is strong against another organism, but weak against another one. 
                This will also be the key of solving puzzles in many ocasions.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                There are three hostile organisms (apart from the virus):

                <br/>
                <br/>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bullet-point">
                            <p>                                
                                <b>Photonic Organism:</b> It's a great threat at long distances, thanks to its ability to detect organism from a certain range 
                                and destroy them with its photonic shot. It alos has a huge vertical jump to get to those high positions to keep its advantage.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                I got to work on this enemy: its <i>locomotion</i> (movement, jump, aim), its AI and its attack.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bullet-point">
                            <p>                                
                                <b>Electric Organism:</b> This enemy is able to float over many obstacles, also allowing it to cover huge horizontal distances.
                                When it detects an organism nearby, it will aggresively follow it emitting a constant electric shock that will kill enemy organism it comes into contact.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bullet-point">
                            <p>                                
                                <b>Crystalline Organism:</b> This organism will just chill haning on the walls and ceilings with its ability to climb any surface. 
                                It will always protect itself from any harm coming from the Photonic Organism thanks to its crystalline surface, which it can aim and 
                                deflect any photonic shots coming its way.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                I coded its AI with a threat priority system, making it able to detect any Photonic Organism from a certain range while there are no other organisms getting 
                                nearby. If there are any other organisms getting close to it, it will come for them, chasing them and, when close enough, stabbing them with its crystalline blade.
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>          
                If the virus is able to come into contact with any of these organisms, it will possess them, gaining their abilites. To visualize this, I worked on a shader that will 
                progressively spawn grey veins from the inside and, eventually, cover the entirety of the organism. It will also progressively change color, zoom in and shake the camera 
                and the controller to feel the full power of the virus.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                I also worked on some game systems, such as a checkpoint system that saves the state of the player, the enemies, and every moving platform to ensure the player respawns in the exact same location and 
                with the exact same interactions they made.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                And much more! I got to work on UI, SFX and interactable components for puzzles.
